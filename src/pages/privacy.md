# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 18, 2024_

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains the information collection, use, and sharing practices of Lockdown Systems LLC (“Lockdown Systems”, “we,” “us,” and “our”).

This Policy describes and governs the information collection, use, and sharing practices of Lockdown Systems with respect to your use of our websites and desktop and mobile apps, including Cyd (collectively, the “Services”).

Before you use or submit any information through or in connection with the Services, please carefully review this Privacy Policy. By using any part of the Services, you understand that your information will be collected, used, and disclosed as outlined in this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

## 1. Our Principles

Lockdown Systems has designed this policy to be consistent with the following principles:

- Privacy policies should be human readable and easy to find.
- Data collection, storage, and processing should be simplified as much as possible to enhance security, ensure consistency, and make the practices easy for users to understand.
- Data practices should meet the reasonable expectations of users.

**Cyd is software that runs directly on your computer, not on our servers. We have designed Cyd so that we don’t have access to your accounts on third-party platforms, or to any of the data in those accounts.**

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us; when we passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device; and from third parties.

### Information You Provide Directly to Us

We will collect any information you provide to us. We may collect information from you in a variety of ways, such as when you: (a) create a Cyd account, (b) purchase a product or service, (c) contact us or provide feedback, (d) submit an error report, or (e) subscribe to our newsletter. This information may include but is not limited to your name, email address, payment information, and your social media handles.

### Information that Is Automatically Collected

_Device/Usage Information_

We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices you use to access the Services. We may collect and analyze (a) device information such as IP addresses, location information (by country and city), browser types, and operating system, and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as the frequency of your use of the Services and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.

Each time you use Cyd to save or delete your data, we collect the total count of each type of data saved or deleted. For example, if you delete 1,200 tweets from an X account, we record that Cyd helped you delete that many tweets, but not which tweets were deleted or which X account they were deleted from.

_Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_

We also collect data about your use of the Services using the privacy-focused analytics service [Plausible](https://plausible.io/data-policy), as well as website and email analytics provided by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/privacy/). Our Services may include cookies (a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website), tracking pixels (tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email), or tracking links (links that can detect clicks before forwarding you to the intended website).

Using these tracking technologies, we strive to only log data that is necessary to (a) understand how users access and find our Services; (b) store your preferences and settings; and (d) assist with security administrative functions.

_Information from Third Parties_

To the extent permitted by law, we may also collect information from third parties, including public sources and social media platforms. Depending on the source, this information collected from third parties could include name, contact information, demographic information, information about an individual’s employer, information to verify identity or trustworthiness, and information for other fraud or safety protection purposes.

Our third-party service providers may collect information that we have access to. For example, if you make a purchase, our payment processor Stripe may collect information related to your payment method and billing address. And if you sign up for our newsletter, Ghost may collect information including your IP address and which form you used to sign up.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We may use the information we collect from and about you to:

- Fulfill the purposes for which you provided it.
- Provide and improve the Services, including to develop new features or services, take steps to secure the Services, and for technical and customer support.
- Send you information about your relationship or transactions with us, account alerts, or other communications, such as newsletters to which you have subscribed.
- Process and respond to your inquiries or to request your feedback.
- Conduct analytics, research, and reporting, including to synthesize and derive insights from your use of our Services.
- Comply with the law and protect the safety, rights, property, or security of Lockdown Systems, the Services, our users, and the public.
- Enforce our [Terms of Use](/terms/), including to investigate potential violations thereof.

Please note that we may combine information that we collect from you and about you (including automatically collected information) with information we obtain about you from third parties and use such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 4. When We Disclose Your Information

We may disclose and/or share your information under the following circumstances:

- Service Providers. We may disclose your information with third parties who perform services on our behalf, including hosting providers, email delivery providers, and payment processors. Our service providers include:
  - [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy) is our cloud hosting provider which hosts our API servers, databases, and other technical infrastructure. This includes our database of users.
  - [Ghost](https://ghost.org/privacy/) hosts the cyd.social website and maintains our newsletters, including the list of newsletter subscriber email addresses.
  - [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/privacy-policy) is the email delivery server we use for transactional emails, such as emailing verification codes. They will receive your email address while sending emails on our behalf.
  - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy) is our payment processor. When you pay for premium services, Stripe retains information about you, your payment method, your billing address, and your billing history.
  - [Plausible](https://plausible.io/privacy) is our analytics service. Plausible does not use cookies or collect personal data, but they do collect aggregate data about the usage of our Services.
- Legal Compliance and Protection of Lockdown Systems and Others. We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or on a good faith belief that such disclosure is permitted by this Privacy Policy or reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the following reasons: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) to respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (d) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Lockdown Systems, our agents and affiliates, our users, and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
- Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may engage in certain business transactions, such as the transfer or sale of our assets. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence) your information may be disclosed. If any of Lockdown Systems’ assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
- Consent. We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose information that can be directly linked to or used to identify you. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing such information are as follows:

- To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You. Much of our processing of information is to meet our contractual obligations to provide services to our users.
- Legitimate Interests. In many cases, we handle information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, these include:
  - Customer service
  - Marketing, advertising, and fundraising
  - Protecting our users, personnel, and property
  - Managing user accounts
  - Analyzing and improving our business
  - Managing legal issues

We may also process information for the same legitimate interests of our users and business partners.

- Legal Compliance. We may need to use and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
- Consent. Where required by law, and in some other cases where legally permissible, we handle information based on consent. Where we handle your information based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, in accordance with applicable law.

## 6. Online Analytics

We may use third-party web analytics services (such as [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)) on our Services to collect and analyze the information discussed above, and to engage in auditing, research, or reporting. The information collected by analytics technologies described in the “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section above will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive to our Site, analyzing usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and providing certain features to you.

Plausible does not use cookies or other persistent identifiers and only collects aggregate data, not personally identifiable data.

## 7. Your Choices and Data Subject Rights

You have various rights with respect to the collection and use of your information through the Services. Those choices are as follows:

- Newsletter Unsubscribe – You may unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each newsletter or by emailing legal@lockdown.systems with your request.
- EU Data Subject Rights – Individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and other jurisdictions have certain legal rights (subject to applicable exceptions and limitations) to obtain confirmation of whether we hold certain information about them, to access such information, and to obtain its correction or deletion in appropriate circumstances. You may have the right to object to our handling of your information, restrict our processing of your information, and to withdraw any consent you have provided. To exercise these rights, please email us at legal@lockdown.systems with the nature of your request. You also have the right to go directly to the relevant supervisory or legal authority, but we encourage you to contact us so that we may resolve your concerns directly as best and as promptly as we can.

## 8. International Transfers

Our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As described above in the “When We Disclose Your Information” section, we may share your information with trusted service providers or business partners in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, in accordance with applicable law. This means that some of your information may be processed in the United States, which may not offer the same level of protection as the privacy laws of your jurisdiction. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.

If we provide any information about you to any third parties information processors located outside of the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy and other data protection laws to govern the transfers of such data.

## 9. Security Measures

We have implemented technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.

## 10. Children

The Services are intended for users over the age of 18 and are not directed at children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information (as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, or personal data (as defined by the EU GDPR) from children under the age of 16, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as practicable.

## 11. Data Retention

We retain the information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy or if we are legally required or permitted to do so. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.

## 12. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy as we update and expand our Services, and we may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. We will post any changes here and revise the date last updated above. We encourage you to check this page periodically for updates to stay informed on how we collect, use and share your information. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice as required by law.
